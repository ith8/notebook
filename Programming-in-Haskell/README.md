This directory contains solutions to chapter excercises from the book [Programming in Haskell](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html), 2nd ed, by Graham Hutton.

Originally, I planned to work with the book Haskell from First Principles, but decided to use Hutton in the end. The code in here are my own attemp at chapter excercises. I hope they would be usefull to anyone likewise is working through this book. 

Please feel free to point out any errors or suggest better approaches.
